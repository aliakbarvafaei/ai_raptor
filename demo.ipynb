This poetic justice allowed Cinderella to be chosen by the prince as his bride, securing her happy ending.\n",

      "Answer:  Cinderella reached her happy ending through a combination of hard work, kindness, and the intervention of magical beings. Here's a summary of how she got there:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The birds' help**: In the garden, the pigeons helped Cinderella prepare for a meal, which seemed to be an unusual and magical occurrence. Later, when her stepsisters asked her to join them at the wedding, the birds again appeared, this time as punishment for their wickedness.\n",
      "2. **The hazel tree's gift**: When Cinderella planted the branch from the hazel-bush on her mother's grave, it grew into a handsome tree that would provide her with guidance and support.\n",
      "3. **Her kindness and prayer**: Throughout the story, Cinderella went to the hazel tree three times a day, wept, and prayed for help. A little white bird always came on the tree and threw down what she had wished for.\n",
      "4. **The magical bird's gift**: On one of her visits to the hazel tree, the bird gave her a beautiful dress that made her look stunning at the wedding.\n",
      "5. **The king's son's choice**: At the wedding, when every girl was summoned to dance with the prince, Cinderella appeared, and the king took her by the hand without hesitation.\n",
      "6. **Poetic justice**: As they rode away together, two white doves cried out that the shoe was not too small for Cinderella, signifying that she was indeed the true bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, Cinderella's happy ending came about through a combination of her own kindness and hard work, the magical intervention of the birds, and the poetic justice that befell her wicked step-sisters.\n"
